# Dice

Not exactly a game, this program simulates rolling a pair of dice a large number of times and prints out the frequency distribution. 
You simply input the number of rolls. 

It is interesting to see how many rolls are necessary to approach the theoretical distribution:  
a) 2  1/36  2.7777...% 
<br>
b) 3  2/36  5.5555...% 
<br>
c) 4  3/36  8.3333...%  
<br>

## Ideas for Modifications 
a) Have the results include a third column showing the percent of rolls each count represents.
<br>
b) Or (better yet) print a low-fi bar graph using rows of asterisks to represent relative values, with each asterisk representing one percent, for example.  
<br>
c) Add a column showing the theoretically expected percentage, for comparison.
<br>
d) Keep track of how much time the series of rolls takes and add that info to the final report. 
<br>
e) What if three (or four, or five...) dice were rolled each time?
